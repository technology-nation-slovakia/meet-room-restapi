_Matej_
> As a member of backend team I focused on data processing on all levels. That means getting data from the source,
> modify and optimize them before storing. Then saving data to the database and provide them on client´s request.
> As a Controller we used Python and SQL for data manipulation.

_Vladimir_
> I have designed and implemented the basic backend architecture, made it modular and easily configurable.
> Such structure gives us possibilities for code re-using within the project. Together with my colleague, Matej,
> I designed and implement the RESTful API, Google calendar data handling and database structure as well.
> Finally, I made our backend project alive by deploying it to a public server.
